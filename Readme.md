# XAF - Open a Detail View When the Grid Row is Clicked in the Dashboard (Blazor)

This example demonstrates how to invoke a Detail View when a user clicks a row in [GridDashboardItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardCommon.GridDashboardItem). In the invoked Detail View, a user can view or edit a [business object](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113664/business-model-design-orm) corresponding to the clicked row.
